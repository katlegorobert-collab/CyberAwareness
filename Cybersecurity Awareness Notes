What is Cybersecurity?
Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access, attacks, or damage. It helps keep our information safe and ensures systems run smoothly.

Common Cyber Threats
1. Phishing – fake emails or messages that try to steal personal details.
2. Malware – harmful software that can damage or steal data.
3. Social Engineering – tricking people into revealing confidential information.
4. Weak Passwords – easy-to-guess passwords can let attackers in.

 How to Stay Safe Online
- Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication.
- Avoid clicking unknown links or downloading from untrusted sources.
- Keep your devices updated.
- Back up important data regularly.
- Be cautious with what you share on social media.

 Why Awareness Matters
Many attacks succeed because of human mistakes. Knowing the basics of cybersecurity helps individuals and organizations prevent costly incidents.
